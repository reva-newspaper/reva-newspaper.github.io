			I'm concerned about the legitimacy of this page. The only reference links to a Rackspace blog. The paragraph following the paragraph containing the reference claims that a Rackspace employee coined the term. Without any other corroborating links or references, this entry appears to be little more than a marketing ploy to legitimize the term 'NoSQL' Dancrumb (talk) 20:24, 15 November 2009 (UTC)

If it helps NoSQL is essentially an advocacy group (a "database movement", whatever that is) and the article should focus on it, its members, structure, events, "beliefs", etc. Indeed many who actively promote these new breed of databases (myself included) don't subscribe to the abrasive approach taken by this particular group and I doubt all those listed in the comparison table are willing participants either.
In terms of Wikipedia policy on verifiable notability I suspect that NoSQL would pass, which is why I have resisted the urge to AfD this article and have in fact encouraged them to contribute to Wikipedia rather than create another repository elsewhere. Hopefully the article will improve significantly however as it is currently not great. -- samj inout 12:56, 23 November 2009 (UTC)
I feel this page is totally legitimate. With all the recent press about the NOSQL movement we need to get this removed ASAP. This page can be a great place for people to get more information on alternatives to RDBMS systems. It provides a great service to the community. I vote we add more references and remove the dispute tag now.--Dan 11:40, 4 December 2009 (UTC)
Check the companies on a Google search who are buying keywords for "nosql" -- I believe this is a totally legit topic and will only get biggger. --209.204.139.40 (talk) 06:14, 7 December 2009 (UTC)
Great point about the Google Keywords. <p>I would like to remove the disputed tag today unless I we get rational arguments. --Dan 13:27, 9 December 2009 (UTC)]
It's disputed "again" since NoSQL isn't English, and use as a buzzword by promoters doesn't make it English. Structured storage is already a legit redirect, as are filter, map, reduce and map, filter, reduce. Sadly MapReduce (CamelCaps are not English, folks!) is a heavily overloaded term used by several companies... — Preceding unsigned comment added by Corrector623 (talk • contribs) 17:48, 29 March 2012 (UTC)
I am changing this sentence: "The reduced run time flexibility compared to full SQL systems is compensated by significant gains in scalability and performance." Several RDBMS's have essentially unlimited scalability. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 173.183.76.129 (talk) 18:54, 15 February 2012 (UTC)
Unlimited scale for what? The statement should be clarified, but it's not inaccurate.</p> It's scalable on tasks where traditional RDBMS systems choke, such as graph traversal which would require a join, join, join, join. It all depends on what your doing. Morphh (talk) 21:46, 15 February 2012 (UTC)

This page is a gross misrepresentation of the topic, its emergence and its major players. I am tempted to believe that a few like Rackspace are using the page to promote their own agenda. For example the statement that Eric Evans reintroduced the term is really a stretch. Also, its a shame that there is no mention of Google, who is the flag bearer of the NoSQL story with its BigTable and success around it. Someone needs to delete this entire page and write a fresh and accurate one in its place. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Tshanky (talk • contribs) 00:59, 3 April 2011 (UTC)

<p>Agreed it now has NPOV tag. Attempted to propose some alternate generic names map, filter, reduce and filter, map, reduce which are at least generic English not CamelCaps crap, and also better than fold (higher-order function) ("higher"?!?!?). MapReduce article has similar problems, generic pipeline the simplest DBs are using needs to be described and clearly differentiated from:
semantic web tech like resolvers and triple stores which are well defined in the language of logical predicates (Wikipedia uses semantic mediawiki now!)
object-oriented databases, which typically extend an object-oriented programming language with persistence and storage
non-SQL RDBMS
network databases
The article says " Academic researchers typically refer to these databases as structured storage," So why is structured storage not the primary disambiguation article that explains the differences between the above? — Preceding unsigned comment added by Corrector623 (talk • contribs) 17:43, 29 March 2012 (UTC)
Why not just call the article Non-relational databases or storage? That is essentially what they are, methinks. What would be best, I assume, is an acceptable consensus among academics, which "structured storage" seems to be (even if, by strict definitions, relational databases are also structured storage). Of course, I'm new here and I'm not familiar with the guidelines of Wikipedia so this is only a suggestion. Luord (talk) 00:18, 6 May 2013 (UTC)
