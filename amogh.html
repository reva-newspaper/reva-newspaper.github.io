 A Brief Report<br>
 About the Event<be>
     <br>
<b> Apple will most likely reveal iOS 13 and macOS 10.15.</b><br>
<br>New versions of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS are practically a given. iOS 13 is rumored to include a dark mode to make nighttime viewing easier.
More interesting will be developments for Project Marzipan, the long-rumored initiative that will reportedly let developers port iOS apps into Mac apps without much additional work.
Bringing iOS apps to Mac could stimulate the nearly 20-year-old computing platform in new ways. Though Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineer Craig Federighi strongly denied merging iOS and Mac into a single platform, the company announced at WWDC several iOS apps such as its News, Stocks, and Voice Memos would be ported to macOS.
And though they're long shots, Apple could also tease the rumored "rOS" (reality operating system) for its rumored AR glasses and perhaps open HomePod to third-party music services.
New hardware?
<br>
Though WWDC is traditionally a software-focused conference, it's possible Apple could announce new hardware like at WWDC 2017.
The MacBook Pros were last updated last July, and despite a new membrane added underneath the third-generation "butterfly" switch keyboards, they're still not as reliable or ergonomic as the keyboards pre-2016 MacBook Pro.
The iMac is really due for an update with the iMac Pro last updated in December 2017 and the 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMacs last revamped in June 2017.
<br>
The MacBook Air and Mac mini got refreshes last fall so we're not expecting Apple to refresh them so soon.
New iPhones are unlikely to be announced at WWDC as well with Apple usually waiting until September to update them. Ditto for Apple Watch Series 5.
Apple's rumored to be preparing device refreshes for the regular 9.7-inch iPad, iPad mini, and AirPods, which could all be released before WWDC. New iPad Prosprobably won't be announced until the fall.

WhatsApp Might Have A Solution To Tackle The Spread Of Fake News in India.
<br>
India is touted to be WhatsApp’s biggest market in the world, with over 200 million users in the country. But instead of it being used as a great new channel for communication, more recently we’ve seen it being used for nether purposes like the spread of misinformation or hoaxes that have led to dire consequences. A new feature was spotted on a WhatsApp beta build, which could help curb just that. This comes right in time for the Indian general election 2019, when such information is likely to be rampant.
WhatsApp Beta 2.19.73 (on Android) brings a “Reverse image search” functionality. This is not a public beta, so you may not currently be able to see it. As dug by WABetaInfo, when you tap on the three-dot menu of an image, it will give you the option to “search image”, which will take you to Google and try to find where else the image has appeared.
WhatsApp hopes that users will use this new functionality as a check-mechanism before forwarding it to others. I won’t say that it’s too much to expect, but they will need to educate users about the existence and benefits of taking this extra step before beginning to spam. It is one of the few steps WhatsApp has taken in this direction to curb the spread of potentially harmful images. Basically, it will tell users if the image has originated on WhatsApp, or somewhere else on the web. It will also quickly show you the necessary information around the image, for you to better judge the authenticity of it.

                    Google Releases First Beta Version Of Android Q

<br>The next version of Android is here... sorta.
Like clockwork, Google's released the first beta version of its mobile operating system, Android Q, for developers. The new version of Android is available to download for all Google Pixel owners — that's for Pixel 1, 2, and 3 — and includes a number of updates ranging from improved security to with the most notable being support for foldable devices.
<br>
One of the biggest issues facing foldable devices is how Android will adapt to the various modes when folded and unfolded. Different devices will have have different display configurations and it's important Android can morph appropriately.
<br>
Google says Android Q comes with several optimizations to help better display apps on foldable devices and large screens. An updated Android Emulator also lets developers start testing their apps for foldable displays even without a foldable device on hand.
<br>
There are two ways to test Android Q on your Pixel, and both are pretty easy. The first is to enroll your Pixel in the Android beta program and get the update pushed to it over the air. If you're more experienced, you can also download the Android system image files from Google here and flash them on yourself.
<br>
Android Q is a beta and as such, it's likely buggy. As always, update at your own risk. We advise updating a device that isn't your primary one to prevent any potential data loss if you're eager to try Android Q.

                    Stop What You're Doing and Update Google Chrome Right Now
<br>Google is urging Chrome users to update the web browser right away to patch a zero-day vulnerability that is being actively exploited.
<br>
In a Tuesday tweet, Google Chrome Security and Desktop Engineering Lead Justin Schuh said users should install the latest version of the browser—72.0.3626.121—right away.
"Seriously, update your Chrome installs... like right this minute," he wrote.
<br>
Google started rolling out the patch for Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux on Friday. This week, Google revealed that the update corrects a "high" severity flaw—CVE-2019-5786—that has been under attack by cybercriminals.
"Google is aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2019-5786 exists in the wild," the web giant said.
<br>
A member of Google's Threat Analysis Group first reported the bug on Feb. 27. At this point, details of the vulnerability are scant, as Google said it's restricting access to bug details until a majority of users have installed the update.
 
As ZDNet notes, the vulnerability is "a memory management error in Google Chrome's FileReader—a web API included in all major browsers that lets web apps read the contents of files stored on the user's computer." The bug may allow for the execution of malicious code.
<br>
For the most part, Chrome updates are automatic, meaning you don't have to do much beyond opening and closing the browser window. It can take a few days to a full week for everyone to be automatically updated to the latest version, however. In this case, you should manually trigger the update to ensure that you're on the latest version as soon as possible.

                    Scientists Were Able to Reverse Time, But There's A Catch
<br>
Scientific studies started as a way to satiate mankind’s curiosity. But not all topics are supposed to be explored, for the safety of humans. One of the hottest entrants on that list is time travel, which has always divided the casually curious from the physicists who believe that it will alter the space-time equation in ways it shouldn’t be.
It would be an overstatement to say that this discovery could help us travel back in time, but definitely, sheds light on why we may never be able to.
<br>
The feat in consideration was achieved by a group of Russian scientists, using an IBM Quantum computer. They ran an experiment where two qubits were allowed to evolve and reach a certain developed quantum state. A ‘qubit’ is a unit of information which, unlike a ‘bit’ that expresses data in binary, can have any value between 0 and 1, or even both simultaneously. Then, the qubits were tried to be brought back to a ‘steady state’, like it was before the start of the experiment, using a complex quantum algorithm. Over thousands of such trials, they were able to achieve an 85% success rate of returning to the original state, which has never been achieved earlier.
<br>

Qubits behave in a highly and increasingly random state, similar to the electrons inside an atom. This entropy is said to move in only one direction, i.e. it will keep on increasing with the passage of time. This concept is called the Arrow of Time, which states that time only moves in one direction.
Since the algorithm was able to bring the two qubits back to their initial state from just a few instances ago, it can be said that they were successful in reversing time in a controlled quantum state. They tried the same experiment with three qubits too, but the success rate was much lower, at 49% due to the increased complexity of the system.
<br>
However, what happened inside a quantum computer might have no real life implications. It is commonly agreed too, that replicating the same effects in real life will be infinitely more difficult. However, this is still a big step for computing, where scientists will be able to get their software to do a double-check on their calculations, by dialling back a few steps. Maybe, this is the closest we will ever come to travelling to a different point in time, and maybe, that’s not a bad thing… Altering history will only cause all the following sessions of time to collapse.
