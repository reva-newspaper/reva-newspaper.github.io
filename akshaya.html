					<p style="font-family: 'bootstrap'; font-size: 22px;color: black;"><br>
					The students from department of School of Management Studies (BBA-2nd semester) were taken to an industrial visit on 12th February 2019 to Akshaya Patra Foundation, VK Hills Kanakapura, Bangalore. The main objective of an industrial visit is to bridge the gap between the theoretical knowledge and its practical training. The practical training provides the information about the industrial environment to the student and helps to widen the practical knowledge. It was a one day visit from morning 9:00 am to 3:00 pm evening. A total of 52 students were taken to the industrial visit. 
<br>The Akashya Patra Foundation  justifies its title "Akshayapatra‟ that means" Inexhaustible
vessel "which was given to Yudhisthira by Sun god that would give unlimited food everyday. It is a place working towards providing free food as a scheme of mid-day meals to as many as 17 lakh students in schools.
<br>The students were taken in University college bus and reached the place by 10:30 am and Mr. Sunil, a representative of the foundation welcomed the team and briefed about the visit. The team was told to wear caps, to cover the head and also was told to cover the mouth for hygiene purpose. 
<br>The students first visited the 4th Floor of the kitchen. The whole process starts at the 4th floor of the building, wherein the major food ingredients will be cleaned at least 2-3 times. Later with the help of pipes the washed ingredients will be sent to 3rd floor for further processing. This process is mechanized and there is a complete connectivity between all the floors. In 2nd floor the mixing and cooking of the ingredients will be done and on 1st floor, in the big containers the cooked food will be kept for further packing and distributions. 
The logistics also has been automatically done and all the vehicles carrying food has GPS connectivity. The Food quality team checks the food at different intervals.
<br>The students and faculty explored the place they learnt management policy of that foundation  and by noon at 12:00 pm, the team was directed to lunch hall. A simple and tasty food was served to the team by the foundation. As there was temple in the same vicinity, team was re-directed to visit the  temple. Students participated in the small pooja and enjoyed the bhajans too.
